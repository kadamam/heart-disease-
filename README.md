# heart-disease prediction
## Overview
This project focuses on developing machine learning models to predict the likelihood of individuals developing heart disease based on a set of clinical and demographic features. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset and advanced predictive analytics techniques, the goal is to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and prevention strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden of cardiovascular diseases.
## Data
The dataset used in this project contains anonymized patient data, including demographic information, medical history, and clinical test results. Data preprocessing steps are applied to clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
#Objective: 
1) To analysis which factor is most affects for heart diseases
2) To analyse which age group has more chances to get heart attack
## Analysis Process
1. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of features and identify potential correlations with heart disease.
2. *Feature Engineering*: Extract relevant features from the dataset and preprocess them for model development.
3. *Model Development*: Build and compare different machine learning models for heart disease prediction, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.
4. *Model Evaluation*: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score
5. ## Results
- Key Findings:
  - Age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and chest pain type are identified as significant predictors of heart disease.
- Model Performance:
  - Logistic Regression: Accuracy - 79%, Precision - 80%, Recall - 79% 
  - Random Forest: Accuracy - 80%, Precision - 87%, Recall - 80%
    
    ## Conclusions
This analysis provides valuable insights into predicting heart disease risk using machine learning techniques. By leveraging predictive models, healthcare professionals can identify high-risk individuals early and implement targeted intervention strategies to prevent cardiovascular diseases and improve patient outcomes.
